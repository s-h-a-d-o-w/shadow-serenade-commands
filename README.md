# s-h-a-d-o-w's Serenade Commands (particularly useful for Linux and Windows)

To learn more about custom Serenade commands, check out the [Serenade Documentation](https://serenade.ai/docs#custom-commands).

## How to install

1. Clone/download into your serenade custom commands directory.
1. Run `yarn` in the root directory.

## Overview

This is not an exhaustive list but the highlights for me that I use every day (depending on the OS I use, obviously ðŸ™‚) are:

- A command to open the dictation box quickly. (Unfortunately, a command to stop dictating and close is currently not possible.)
- A ton of special key commands, so that I don't need to keep saying `press` before everything when wanting to trigger special keys.
- Resizing windows to fit an area that doesn't overlap with serenade. (Windows and `wmctrl`/`xdotool` on Linux)
- An emoji command! ðŸ˜Š (On Linux, it requires a running `xed`.)
- **(Linux only!)** Switching from headphones to speakers and vice versa, using `pactl`/`pacmd`.
